### 17/11/2018 Divide et impera
First thing first, I need to clearly divide what need to be done to be good at this, internet is full of semi-guides, old guides, and things that can mislead you and make you lose time. 

There are only 2 website you need to check: http://www.fuzzysecurity.com/ and https://www.corelan.be/ these are holyBible2.0 of hacking resources. But, not the only one needed. For general reference on the topic https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/exploit-development-everything-you-need-know-0167801/
