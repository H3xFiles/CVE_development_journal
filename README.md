The biggest challenge so far is to create a real plan of action , the resources online are pkently, but most of time these resources are redundant, depracated, inaccurate. Therefore a challenge before the challenge is to make a clear path of what I need to learn.

There are 2 website you(I) need to check: http://www.fuzzysecurity.com/ and https://www.corelan.be/ these are holyBible2.0 of hacking resources. But, not the only one needed. For general reference on the topic https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/exploit-development-everything-you-need-know-0167801/ and a [link](https://github.com/topics/exploit-development) to the github by topic.
